# VP3-Weather-Receiver Hardware
*Davis Vantage Pro Weather Station Reciever using a Moteieino board with RFM69 and Color TFT Display*

This folder provides the hardware info for this project. The circuit board in the main page is an early version.  The current board will be available on OSHPark so you can just order boards if you want them as-is.  The main differences are some minor circuit fixes, a slight size adjustment (to fit in a case i have for the station) and embedding the RTC and battery on th board.  The original PCB was ony intended to use plug in modules and make it a little mor erobust than protoboards.

# Schematic

The schematic is in KiCAD format, here is it is if you dont have that software.

The circuit board is shown assembled in these 3D renderings.  The circuit board will accomodate 2 sizes of displays. The LiPo battery is sanwidched in between the display and main PCB.  There are 3 tactile switches to set the clock and other parameters. You may want to use the long plunger types if you are putting in some sort of case. They can be mounted on either side of the board as well.
