# VP3-Weather-Receiver Hardware
*Davis Vantage Pro Weather Station Reciever using a Moteieino board with RFM69 and Color TFT Display*

This folder provides the hardware info for this project. The circuit board in the main page is an early version.  The current board will be available on OSHPark so you can just order boards if you want them as-is.  The main differences are some minor circuit fixes, a slight size adjustment (to fit in a case i have for the station) and embedding the RTC and battery on th board.  The original PCB was ony intended to use plug in modules and make it a little mor erobust than protoboards.
